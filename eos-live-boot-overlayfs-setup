# /sysroot/ostree needs special handling:
setup_ostree_flatpak_overlay() {
    # The flatpak deployment dirs must be on the same filesystem (namely
    # /sysroot) as the ostree repo, so files can be hardlinked between them
    # rather than copied. We normally achieve this with these symlinks:
    #
    # /var/lib/flatpak      --> /sysroot/flatpak
    # /sysroot/flatpak/repo --> /ostree/repo
    # /ostree               --> /sysroot/ostree
    #
    # For a live boot, we cannot overlay /sysroot directly: we need to read an
    # xattr from the real (lower) directory, but if the upper dir exists (which
    # it always does at the root of the mount!) then overlayfs returns xattrs
    # from that. But if we put separate overlays on /sysroot/ostree and
    # /sysroot/flatpak, hardlinks between them do not work.
    #
    # It just so happens that the only entry that /sysroot/ostree and
    # /sysroot/flatpak have in common is 'repo', which is meant to be identical
    # anyway. So, we merge both directories together over /sysroot/ostree:

    rm -f /var/lib/flatpak
