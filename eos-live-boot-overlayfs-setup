# /sysroot/ostree needs special handling:
setup_ostree_flatpak_overlay() {
    # The flatpak deployment dirs must be on the same filesystem (namely
    # /sysroot) as the ostree repo, so files can be hardlinked between them
    # rather than copied. We normally achieve this with these symlinks:
    #
    # /var/lib/flatpak      --> /sysroot/flatpak
    # /sysroot/flatpak/repo --> /ostree/repo
    # /ostree               --> /sysroot/ostree
    #
    # For a live boot, we cannot overlay /sysroot directly: we need to read an
    # xattr from the real (lower) directory, but if the upper dir exists (which
    # it always does at the root of the mount!) then overlayfs returns xattrs
    # from that. But if we put separate overlays on /sysroot/ostree and
    # /sysroot/flatpak, hardlinks between them do not work.
    #
    # It just so happens that the only entry that /sysroot/ostree and
    # /sysroot/flatpak have in common is 'repo', which is meant to be identical
    # anyway. So, we merge both directories together over /sysroot/ostree:
    local lowerdir=/sysroot/ostree:/sysroot/flatpak
    local upperdir=/run/eos-live/ostree-flatpak
    local workdir=$upperdir-workdir
    [ -d $workdir ] && return;
    mkdir -p $upperdir $workdir
    mount -t overlay -o \
        rw,upperdir=$upperdir,lowerdir=$lowerdir,workdir=$workdir \
        eos-live-ostree-flatpak /sysroot/ostree

    # Adjust the symlink to point to this ostree/flatpak chimera:
    rm -f /var/lib/flatpak
    ln -s /sysroot/ostree /var/lib/flatpak

    # And leave /sysroot/flatpak uncovered; since it is only ever referenced
    # via the /var/lib/flatpak symlink.
}
setup_ostree_flatpak_overlay

# Everything else is pretty straightforward:
overlay_dirs="bin boot endless home lib opt ostree root sbin srv sysroot/home var"
